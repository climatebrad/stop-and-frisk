# FIS-Mod4-Project
This project examines the relationship between crime rate and the stop-question-frisk policy change in NYC.

Date: December 2019

Project Members: Brad Johnson and Anil Onal

Goals: To come up with the model specification appropriate to examine the proposed relationship, collect the necassary data, and train and test the model.

Responsibilities:
 - Define project scope and focus
 - Collect data
 - Formulate question
 - Perform exploratory data analysis
 - Train a model
 - Test the model
 - Create Master Notebook
 - Create presentation
 - Lint/clean code file
 
Summary of files:
 - Master_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook documenting the code and the analysis for the project. Written for a technical audience
 - data files:
     - df.csv: reported offenses, arrests, stops, and population aggregated annually and at the precinct level
     - borough_df.csv: borough and precinct data
     - offense_types_df.csv : offense types and keys data
     The following files have been used to create df.csv:
